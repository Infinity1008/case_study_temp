## Data cleaning and acquisition

Use the Ukraine conflict data from this [source](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html?m=1) and [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/t9a764/oc_equipment_losses_in_the_ukrainerussian_war/) to show:
1. How real world information is disseminated?
2. What biases one needs to keep in mind while collecting the data?
3. Suggest what conclusions can be drawn and can't be drawn
4. Elaborate on how collected data should be exposed
